## üìù **About the Project**
Healthcare systems often face issues related to data privacy, interoperability, and trust. Our solution tackles these problems by integrating blockchain technology, ensuring that patient data is securely stored, easily accessible, and only shared with authorized organizations.

Through **Hospi_Blocks**, we aim to:
- Eliminate duplicate patient records
- Enhance data privacy and integrity
- Simplify authentication for healthcare providers
- Foster a secure, scalable, and interoperable healthcare ecosystem

### üîß **How It Works**
1. **Patient Registration:** Patients register by providing verified identification, which creates a unique blockchain entry.
2. **Data Management:** Medical records, prescriptions, lab images, etc., are securely stored using IPFS, with their hashes stored on the blockchain.
3. **Authentication & Access:** Authorized organizations can access and update patient data using smart contracts, ensuring data integrity and security.

## ‚ú® **Features**
- **Blockchain Integration:** Secure storage of data using a decentralized approach.
- **IPFS Storage:** Efficient handling of large files (e.g., lab images, medical records).
- **Smart Contracts:** Manage permissions and data access securely.
- **Identity Verification:** Use biometric and government-issued IDs for patient verification.
- **Role-Based Access:** Doctors, hospital admins, and insurance agents have different access levels.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Smart Contracts (Solidity), Web3.js
- **Storage:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Authentication:** OAuth2, JWT, Biometric Verification
